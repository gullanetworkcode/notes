Blocks can be used to lump tasks together e.g. have a few tasks and one 'when' conditional.
  Can also be used for graceful of error handling in tasks using "rescue" and "always" sections.

changed_when:
  can be used to specify when something has actually changed.
  Useful for when you run a command rather than a module as running a command will always show as changed unless using "changed_when"
  use of "not" can be useful here

failed_when:
  can be used to specify when something has actually failed
  Useful when using commands rather than running a module
  Use of "not" here can make sure anything that is unexpected is treated as an error
