Questions
  What type of Distro is CentOS? RHEL
  SED research


Installation
  Text install same across most Linux distributions
  Don't use _ in hostname (not DNS compatiable)
  Seperate partitions for /home etc folders for stability (Stops drives getting full)
  Partitions
    /boot
    /swap
    /root

Updates/Packages
  apt-get (Debian update software - (dpkg - old software))
    apt-get update  #Updates local database with latest version info
    apt-get upgrade  #Performs upgrade of all packages, never removes a package if dependency removed
    apt-get dist-upgrade  #Removes dependencies #If using third party software this may break things
    apt-get install <package>  #installs package specified
    apt-get upgrade <package>/apt-get dist-upgrade <package> #updates specific package
    apt-get dist-upgrade #Upgrades operating system
    apt-get remove <package>
    apt-get --purge remove <package> #removes cached copy of package
    sources.list in /etc/apt #list of repositories system is using
    sources.list.d #list of official sources
    apt.conf #in /usr/share/doc/apt/examples
    apt-key add <key>

  aptitude #menu driven package control

  

  dpkg
  	dpkg -l #Lists packages installed
  	dpkg -l <package> #details of package
  	dpkg -S <file> #which package created the file

  yum (redhat)
  	yum update #Updates local database with latest version info
  	yum update <package>
  	yum install <package>
  	yum list <search_term> #use wildcards!
  	yum info <search> #info on package
  	yum erase <package> #removes package
  	yum remove <package>  #doesn't remove dependencies
  	yum groupinstall <software_group>  #install group of software (e.g. SQL Server)
  	yum grouplist
	yum provides <program> #lookis in packages for tools that don't have own package (e.g. ifconfig)
    Repositories - /etc/yum.repos.d
      Can create repo files for new repositories (edited text in file)
      Keys required from developer (rpm -i-import <key>)

  rpm
    Mostly used to gather information these days as it doesn't handle dependancies
    rpm -i <package_name> #simplist inastall command
    rpm -u <package_name> #updates package (installs if not already installed)
    rpm -ivh <package_name> #v=verbose h=hashmarks
    rpm -Uvh <package_name>
    rpm -qa #query all packages
    rpm -qi <package_name> #shows version of package
    rpm -Vp <package_name> #verifies to see if any files are missing
    rpm2cpio <package> > <cpio_archive> - converts into a format that means you can get to the individual files in a package
      cpio -i --make-directories < <cpio_archive>
    Package Names
      <program>-<version>-<build_number>.<architecture>.<processor>
      noarch - not dependant on anything


Network adapter
  Enabling
    edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
      Change "ONBOOT=yes", "BOOTPROTO=dhcp", "NM_CONTROLLED=no"
    command - chkconfig network on  #makes sure network card is on after reboot

  less <file> #same as more command but able to scroll both ways and search
  sed -i <insert> -a <append> #text editing for use in scripts

Regular Expressions
  man 7 regex #regex user documentation
  range []
    [<item>,<item>] #e.g fis[h,hing,hed]
    [<start>-<end>] #e.g test0[2-3].txt
  wildcards
    . #any one character
    * #any number of previous character
    .* #works like a normal * wildcard

    \ #escape characte

  examples
    egrep #same as gerp -E
    grep -r  <string> <folder>
    ifconfig | grep -E "ether|eno" #looks for both those expressions

Vi
  Enter command mode by default
 
  h #left
  l #right

  :<begin_line>_<end_line>s/<search_string>/<replacement_string>  #search and replace within lines specified
  :<begin_line>_<end_line><command> #specifies range that command applies to
  .vimrc #configuration file, add commands to always run

Shared Libraries
  .so #shared object
  stored in:-
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
  <library>.so.<major_version>.<minor_version>
  Software linked. Only one library present, major version linked to minor version
  May have more than one major version
  ld #library deamon
  ldconfig -v #list of all libraries on system #shows link name
  ldd <program> #list dependencies
  Third party files:-
    file /etc/ld.so.conf says to include everyting in ld.so.conf folder
  To manually add library:-
    1: Copy file to /usr/lib64 (or /usr/lib)
    2: Add link (Symbolic Link)
         Hard Link
         ln <target_file> <name_of_link> #usually just the major version part of the name
         Change permission (usually 755)
         (Hard links need to be on same partitions, don't work for directories either)
         Soft Link
         ln <target_file> <name_of_link> -s #usually just the major version part of the name
  If wanting to use updated library, install new library, remove link, add new link

Managing Processes
  ps -a #list all processes for current user
  ps -A #lists processes for all users
  ps -u root #list all root processes (Ubuntu)
  [ctrl]z #puts process into background
  jobs #shows programs running
  fg <job_number> #brings process back into use
  %<job_number> #same as above
  kill <process_id> #get job id from ps
  <application> & #run as a service
  stress -c 1 -timeout 180 #runs CPU at 100% for specified time
  nice -n <priority> <program> #how much priority a program gets -20 = top priority
    can re-nice in top
  killall -i <program> #kills all instances of same program -q for no prompts
  kill -9 #kill without prejudice

Hardware
  dmesg #displays boot sequence
  Drivers
    lsmod #see all different modules loaded on top of the kernel
    lspci #list all pci cards (and integrated modules) that were detected
    lsusb #list removable components
    modprob #to manage modules
      modprob <module_name>
    rmmod #to remove modules
    cat /proc/modules #lists modules that are running (additional information - Is it live and an address)
  /dev #folder for all hardware
  /etc/udev/rules.d/ & /lib/udev/rules.d/ #rules files to map hardware to names
  Check BIOS > Check Driver > Delve into commands above
  Redirecting video output to serial port (virtual hardware)
    edit /boot/grub/grub.conf
      disable splash image
      add following lines below hidden menu line
        "serial --unit=1 --speed=9600"
        "terminal --timeout=300 console serial"
      add "console=tty0 console=ttyS1,9600n8" to end of kernel line
    edit /etc/securetty
      add line:-
        "ttyS1"
    edit /etc/init/ttyS1.conf
      "start on runlevel [1345]
       stop on runlevel [S06]
       respawn
       instance /dev/ttyS1
       exec /sbin/agetty ttyS1 9600 vt100-nav"
    edit /etc/inittab
      change id:5:initdefault to id:3:initdefault
    
Hard Disks
  Maybe put home directory in different partition
  Disks go from SDA - SDB - SDC etc SDx
  Partitions SDA1 - SDA2 - SDA3 etc SDAn
  Work flow
    Partition
    Format (adding a file system)
    Mount
    (Make mount at reboot)
  fdisk #command line tool for administering disks
  fdisk /dev/SDx #enters tool for amending partitions.
    Only 4 primary partitions
  gdisk #another disk utility
  mkfs #used to format disk
    mkfs -t <file_system_type> <partition> #example
  mount #shows what is mounted
  mount <hardware> <folder> #mount hardware to a folder
    mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom 
  df -h #human readable disk usage
  To make the mount persist at reboot:-
    edit /etc/fstab

LVM
  Advanced partition manager
  pvcreate <drive(s)> #imports physical drives into LVM
  pvdsiplay #displays drives mapped into LVM
  create volume group
    vgcreate <name> <drives_part_of_group>
      vgcreate vg1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc #example
    vgdisplay #display volume group information
  create logical volume
    lvcreate -L <size> <volume_group> -n <name> #create logical volume (partition)
    lvdisplay #display logical
  lvresize -L +<size> <logical_partion> #resizes volume
    need to size file system too..
  resize2fs <logical_partition> #ext resizes partition to maximum size
  vgextend <name_of_volume_group> <drive> #adds drive to volume group

File system health
  /etc/fstab #file of accessible file systems
  5 ways to reference file systmes
    Filename:     /dev/sda1
    Label:        LABEL=Sales
    UUID:         UUID=1318f765-f170-4933-8295-fd49ba6f040a
    GPT Label:    PARTLABEL=EFI
    GPT UUID:     PARTUUID=c6c21355-9dbe-485f-a50a-d422458bc1e2
  lsblk -f #shows block devices (apart from GPT)
  blkid #shows GPT block devices
  tune2fs -L <label> <drive> #Add/change label on drive

  df -h #shows disk usage
  du -h #shows file usage
  du -c #shows total at end

  fsck #file system integrity check
  fsck -t <file_system_type> <drive> #specifies drive to check

  fstransform #converts file system for drive

  debugfs #creates RAM drive for use with debugging etc

  dumpe2fs <file system> #lots of information about the file system

  tune2fs #can change drive settings
  tune2fs -c 60 -i 6m <drive> #do file system check every 60 mounts or every 6 months
  tune2fs -j <drive> #turns on journalling (for ext2 drive)
    edit fstab and set drive to ext3

File Management
  ls -F # Directories show up as <file>/
  first character . means hidden file
  cd #No parameters means go to root
  cp ./<sub_directory> #copies to relative sub directory
  cp -R * ./<directory> #Recursive mode, copies sub-directories too
  rm -r ./<sub_directory> #removes sub-directory and files

File Archives
  tar #tape archive #combined with gzip usually
  gzip #compresses
    tar cvfz <archive_filename>.tgz <files_to_backup> #create gzip volume
    tar xvcf <archive_file_to_unpack> #expand archive
  cpio #copy io, usually combined with find.
    find ./<files> | cpio -o > <backup_file>.cpio #create archive
    find ./<files> | cpio -o | > gzip <backup_file>.cpio.gz #create zipped archive
    gunzip ./<backup_file>.cpio.gz
     gpio -i < <backup_file>.cpio # extracts files
  dd #disk duplicator
    sudo dd if=<volume> of=<output_file>.img #backs up everything (including white space!!)
    #reverse for restoring images bit by bit

File Permissions
  User #person who owns the file
  group #group in control of file
  permissions
    1 - File or directory #d for directory
    2-4 - permissions for users
    5-7 - permissions for groups
    8-10 - permissions for others (i.e. not user or groups)
      -uuugggooo
    r #read
    w #write
    x #execute
  chown #change owner/group
    chown <user>:<group> <file> #change ownership
    chown -R <user>:<group> <directory> #change ownership on all files in a directory
  chmod #change permissions
    chmod u+x <file> #modifies user to add execute
      u #user
      g #group
      o #others
      w #write
      r #read
      +
      - #take away permissions
      x #execute
      , #set multiple permissions at once
    chomd 700 <file> #using bit values
      4 - read
      2 - write
      1 - execute
  umask #set default permissions #defined in .bashrc
    same as subnet masks
  chgrp <group> #will just change group

Disk Quotas
  per drive configuration
  edit /etc/fstab
    add ,usrquota,grpquota where defauls is.
    need to reboot or unmount/remount
      mount <drive> <folder> -o <same options as fstab file>
  quotacheck -cug <mount_point> #create quota database, u #user, g #group
    aquota.user/group created
  quotaon -a #turns on quotas for everyone, -u <user>, -g <group>, #default quota of 0!
  quotaoff #reverse of on
  edquota <user>/<group>
    can't edit blocks or inodes
    dumpe2fs <drive> #block size for drive
    Will need to do some maths!!
    Can use actual sizes sometimes
  quota <uaer>/<group> #views quota information
  repquota -vsgu <mount point> #information about all quotas on drive

Locating files
  fhs #file hierachy standard #can google this
  /bin #binary files #distribution files
  /sbin #system binarys, expected to be used by the operation system.
    rarely modify bin or sbin
  /usr #user programs, programs that user has installed
    has own /bin and /sbin
  /etc #configuration files
  /dev #devices (hardware)
  /proc #processes information
  /var #variable,various - whatever you want e.g. web pages
  /tmp #temporary files #wiped out every reboot
  /lib /lib64 #Libraries
    /usr/lib
  /opt #optional add-ons (used a lot by redhat)
  /mnt #mounts
  /media #used a lot on moderen systems instead of /mnt
  /srv #used by services to store data #not every service uses this folder

Boot Loaders
  GRUB
    /boot/grub #usually
    grub.cfg #used by grub version 2 only
    menu.list #used in grub 1, combined into grub.cfg in grub v2
    grub v1
      really only files needed are: grub.conf and menu.lst
      grub.conf
        default=0 #choose first OS in list
        title #distrubution
        chainloader +1 #turn over to new bootloader
      menu.lst #on some distros this has all the menu options, in red hat this is combined into the grub.conf file
      grub-install <drive>
      efibootmgr -c -l \\EFI\\rehat\grub.efi -L GRUB #command required to reinstall grub on EFI system
    grub v2
      GRUB v2 uses it's own editer without needing to edit grub.cfg
      /etc/default/grub #contains default grub config
      takes any file from /etc/grub.d
      grub2-mkconfig #run this to compile new grub bootloader config #orgrub-mkconfig #or update-grub #or upgrade-grub2
      easier to update when grub is running


Linux initialization
  /sbin/init #initialization programme, fires up SysV initialization process
  run levels
    1 #Single user mode, used during maintenance - locks other users out.
    2 #Multi user CLI mode, no networking
    3 #Full mult user CLI
    4 #Not defined, can define your own
    5 #Multi user with GUI
    runlevel #shows previous and current run levelsmore 
    init <run_level> #changes to that run level
  SysV limitations #all config in one file, only recognizes hardware at init
  UPSTART
    Compatible with SysV init
    Multiple config files
    Easier commands
    /etc/init/ contains all the scripts for init
    Add script for each process, specifying which level to run at
    chkconfig <service> on #command to tell init to start the service
    chkconfig --level <levels> <service> on #tells init to run this service at these run levels
    chkconfig --list #shows services and how they are configured

  Sysd
    Binary, not a script
    Faster that sysv init
    Copes with hot plug hardware, always running
    If /sbin/init is a sym link then running systemd #ignore sysv config files
    target = groups of units
    need to define dependancies for units
    /lib/systemd #where executables for systemd are
    /lib/systemd/system #where units and targets are stored
    units
      services #e.g http-service
      mount
      automount
      devices
      paths
      snapshot
      socket
    target
      collection of units
    Can view configuration of units (not scripts)
    systemctl #systemd controller
    systemctl start <unit> #to control things #old commands are mapped
    default.target #default grouping of units

X Windows
  At the base of most/all gui systems
  also known as xorg
  In Sysv need to pick run level x11
  In Systemd need to set target to graphical.target
    systemctl set-default TARGET.target
  yum groupinstall "X Windows System" "Desktop" "Fonts" #installs GUI with default GUI for distro
  yum groupinstall "X Windows System" "KDE desktop" "Fonts" #installs GUI with non-default GUI #e.g. on centos
  /etc/sysconfig/desktop #file that defines what desktop to launch
  /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients #which interface to use #$DESKTOP variable set by user
  
  Xorg -configure #configures system (need to init 3)
    Makes xorg.conf.new is best guess of configuration
    X #launches graphical user interface
    X -config <custom config file> #Runs against config file
    /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ #directory for default config file

  gconf-editor #useful tool for editing gdm
  xwininfo #shows details about certain windows
  xdpyinfo #shows all of windows configuration settings

  /usr/share/config/kdm #where configuration for kdm desktop is stored

  lightdm
   /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/ #where config files for lightdm are kept
   /etc/lightdm/users.conf #what users are allowed to use lightdm
   
  Remote Access
    x forward across ssh tunnel
    cygwinx - allows to run x windows from Microsoft windows
    xhost# who is allowed to run x
      xhost si:localuser:<username> #user allowed to run x remotely
      configure server side
        xhost inet:<ip_address>:<username> #restricts by IP
	      xhost + #turns off access-control #do not just do this!! configure IP tables to only allow SSH
	    configure client side
	      /etc/ssh/ssh_config #make sure ForwardX11Trusted yes is un-commeted out
	    connect to remote server
	      ssh -Y <username>@<server> # connect and do x-forwarding
	      echo $Display #confirms tunneling of x-windows (anything other than :0)
	      <program> & #runs program with display locally
